Big O Of SLL:
Insertion - O(1)
Removal - it depends. If removing the head -> O(1) if removing the tail -> O(n)
searching - O(n)
access - O(n)

SLL excel when Insertion and deletion from the beginning are frequently required 
arrays contain a built in index LL do not 

Big O DLL:
Insertion: o(1)
removal: O(1)
searching: O(N) even if its O(N/2) that still simplifies to O(N)
access: O(N)

Recap:
DLL are just like SLL theres just that extra pointer (prev)
DLL are better for searching they do take up more memory because of the extra pointer
