Radix sort is an integer only algorithm it does not make comparisons 
- usually used on binary 
- exploits the fact that information about the size of the number is encoded in the number of digits 
- with a list of numbers you put them into buckets based on what integer your looking at starting at the far right and making sure your factoring in however many digits your biggest number has smaller numbers with less digits go into the zero bucket once you've looked at all their digits
