Unlike the other algos (bubble, insertion and selection) merge quick and radix sort are O(n log n) algorithms. This means that they are much faster than the O(n^2) algorithms. Merge sort is a stable sort, which means that it preserves the order of equal elements. This is important when you are sorting objects that have multiple keys. Merge sort is also a comparison sort, which means that it can sort any type of data for which a comparison function is defined.

How merge sort works:
    - its a combination of two things - merging and sorting
    - it exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
    - works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array
    - You start with one array and split it in half, then you split those in half, and so on until you have a bunch of arrays with only one element
    - Then you merge those arrays back together, in the correct order
    
Big O Cheat Sheet: https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/
merge sort is O(n log n) The n is number of comparisions if I have an array of 1000 items I have 1000 comparisions the log n is the decompositions if I have an array of 32 items I have 5 decompositions (splits) before they are all split into single element arrays
quick sort is best and average case is O(n log n) worst case O(n2) this happens when the pivot is the min or max element everytime to fix that instead of picking the first element pick the middle element but bottom line is there is no sure fire way of avoiding the possiblity of worse case scenerio
